## Pattern Detection Logic

The study uses the following criteria to identify patterns:

1. **Body Size Ratios**: Compares candlestick body size to range
2. **Shadow Analysis**: Evaluates upper and lower shadow lengths
3. **Multi-Candle Relationships**: Checks open/close/high/low relationships across candles
4. **Gap Detection**: Identifies gaps between consecutive candles
5. **Engulfing & Containment**: Validates body engulfment and containment for Harami patterns
6. **Opposing Candle Colors**: Validates color requirements for patterns like Tweezer Top/Bottom

All pattern definitions and criteria are based on [The Chart Guys](https://www.chartguys.com/candlestick-pattern-cheat-sheet) authoritative candlestick pattern reference.

## Usage Tips

1. **Combine with Trend Analysis**: Patterns are more reliable when aligned with the overall trend
2. **Wait for Confirmation**: Consider waiting for the next candle to confirm the pattern
3. **Use with Support/Resistance**: Patterns at key levels are more significant
4. **Volume Confirmation**: Check volume for additional confirmation (not done by this study)
5. **Filter Settings**: Use the enable/disable toggles to focus on specific pattern types
6. **Pattern Priority**: Triple-bar patterns take priority over double-bar, which take priority over single-bar patterns
