# Version 1.0.1 - Intelligent Trend Detection

## 🎯 Major Enhancement: Smart Trend Detection

This release introduces **intelligent trend detection** using the industry-standard 50/200 moving average system, dramatically improving signal quality by ensuring patterns only appear when they have predictive value.

## ✨ What's New

### Dual Moving Average Trend Detection (50/200 MA)

The study now uses a sophisticated dual MA system for reliable trend identification:

- **Fast MA (50-period)**: Provides faster trend confirmation
- **Slow MA (200-period)**: The gold standard for trend direction
- **MA Slope Analysis**: Detects rising/falling trends
- **MA Alignment**: Confirms trend strength (50 above/below 200)
- **Configurable Threshold**: Price must be 0.5% away from 200MA by default

### Context-Aware Pattern Filtering

Patterns now only appear when market conditions make them meaningful:

✅ **Bullish Reversals** → Only in downtrends
- Hammer, Inverted Hammer, Dragonfly Doji
- Bullish Engulfing, Bullish Harami, Piercing Line
- Morning Star, Three White Soldiers, Three Inside/Outside Up

✅ **Bearish Reversals** → Only in uptrends
- Shooting Star, Hanging Man, Gravestone Doji
- Bearish Engulfing, Bearish Harami, Dark Cloud Cover
- Evening Star, Three Black Crows, Three Inside/Outside Down

✅ **Neutral Patterns** → All market conditions
- Doji, Long-Legged Doji, Spinning Top

### Confirmation Patterns Toggle

New dedicated checkbox for confirmation patterns:
- Three Inside Up
- Three Inside Down
- Three Outside Up
- Three Outside Down

Independent control from general 3-bar patterns setting.

## 🔧 Improvements

### Visual Enhancements
- **Cleaner Charts**: Bullish/bearish markers reduced to VERY_SMALL size
- **Better Readability**: Neutral patterns remain MEDIUM size for visibility

### Better Defaults
- **Trend Threshold**: Increased from 0.1% to 0.5% for better reliability
- **Optimal Settings**: Pre-configured for immediate use with industry-standard values

### Pattern Tooltips
- Added pattern meanings from The Chart Guys
- Hover over any marker to see pattern description

## 📊 Configuration

### New Settings

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Require Correct Trend Context | ✓ Enabled | On/Off | Filter patterns by trend |
| Fast MA Period | 50 | 10-100 | Fast moving average |
| Slow MA Period | 200 | 100-300 | Slow moving average |
| Trend Threshold % | 0.5% | 0.0-5.0% | Price deviation threshold |
| Detect Confirmation Patterns | ✓ Enabled | On/Off | Three Inside/Outside toggle |

## 🚀 Benefits

### Reduced False Signals
Without trend filtering, you might see:
- "Three Outside Down" (bearish reversal) in a downtrend → meaningless ❌
- "Morning Star" (bullish reversal) in an uptrend → meaningless ❌

With trend filtering, patterns only appear when they're actually useful ✅

### Improved Signal Quality
- **Higher Accuracy**: Patterns align with market context
- **Better Timing**: Reversal signals appear at trend extremes
- **Cleaner Charts**: Less clutter, more meaningful markers

### Flexible Configuration
- **Strict Mode** (0.1-0.2% threshold): Fewer, higher-quality signals
- **Balanced Mode** (0.5% threshold): Recommended default
- **Relaxed Mode** (1.0%+ threshold): More signals in ranging markets

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Trend Detection Algorithm

```
UPTREND requires:
- Price > 0.5% above 200MA
- 200MA rising (positive slope)
- 50MA above 200MA

DOWNTREND requires:
- Price > 0.5% below 200MA
- 200MA falling (negative slope)
- 50MA below 200MA

SIDEWAYS when:
- Flat 200MA
- Conflicting signals
- Price within threshold
```

### Pattern Categorization

Patterns are intelligently categorized by their trend requirement:
- **Downtrend Patterns**: 14 bullish reversals
- **Uptrend Patterns**: 14 bearish reversals
- **Neutral Patterns**: 3 indecision patterns + 2 continuation patterns
